I"Á<p><strong>Welcome</strong> to the web site of our multi-disciplinary research program on Integrated Foundations of Sensing, Modeling, and Data Assimilation (short: ‚ÄúSea Ice MURI‚Äù).</p>

<p>In this MURI project, established in 2020, we seek to develop a computational toolkit that enhances the information we can extract from currently existing environmental data and physical knowledge to improve environmental variables prediction.</p>

<p>Our team consists of six multi-university leading researchers with multi-disciplinary backgrounds, including expertise in mathematics, statistics, engineering, and physics. We are supported by the Department of Defense MURI program through the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR).</p>
